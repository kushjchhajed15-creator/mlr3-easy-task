#             1] My Logic & Dataset Choice

## 1. Iris (ID 59)
I used this as a control to verify that `mlr3oml` is pulling data correctly from the OpenML API. It serves as the standard benchmark for the `otsk()` function.

## 2. Pen vs. Pencil
I designed this custom task to verify my own understanding of how `mlr3` handles mixed feature types. By creating a dataset from scratch with specific attributes (length, ink, material), I could confirm that the task construction logic works exactly as intended before moving on to larger datasets.

#                     2] Implementation

In this section, we load the core `mlr3` libraries and execute the task creation logic.

```{r setup, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading core libraries
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3oml)
library(data.table)
 
task_iris = as_task(otsk(id = 59))
print(task_iris)

# Building the dataset from scratch
stationery_data = data.table(
  length_cm     = c(14.5, 15.0, 13.8, 17.5, 18.2, 19.1),
  has_ink       = factor(c("Yes", "Yes", "Yes", "No", "No", "No")),
  has_eraser    = factor(c("No", "No", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "Yes")),
  body_material = factor(c("Plastic", "Plastic", "Metal", "Wood", "Wood", "Wood")),
  label         = factor(c("Pen", "Pen", "Pen", "Pencil", "Pencil", "Pencil"))
)

# Creating the classification task
task_pen_pencil = as_task_classif(stationery_data, target = "label", id = "pen_vs_pencil")

# Printing task details to verify construction
print(task_pen_pencil)
```

#              4]  Note: Dataset Selection Rationale

While datasets like **TITANIC** or **CREDIT-G** are common choices, I opted for a custom-built **PEN VS. PENCIL** task. 

This decision was made to move beyond standard benchmarks and demonstrate a deeper grasp of the `mlr3` workflow. By defining my own features from scratch, I can verify that the conversion from a raw `data.table` to an `mlr3` task functions perfectly with specific data types I controlled, ensuring a more rigorous test of the underlying logic.
